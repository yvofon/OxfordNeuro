The research project was aimed at investigating hippocampal contributions to memory-guided attention

Two behavioral tasks were developed to study memory-guided attention: Catch the critter and Place the critter
Both tasks involved animals popping up in a natural scene at a specific place and time. 

The code included here is associated with three separate studies: 

1) The behavioral study investigated whether the experimental manipulation was effective

2) The EEG study aimed to find neural signatures of predictive information associated with memory-driven attention

3) The intracranial EEG study focused on characterizing neural mechanisms of memory-driven attention contributions of the hippocampus.
